       <h2>What is Bicol Express</h2>
        <p>Bicol Express, known natively in Bikol as sinilihan ('spiced with chili'), is a popular Filipino dish which was popularized in the district of Malate, Manila but made in traditional Bicolano style. <br> <p>It is a stew made from long chili peppers (siling haba in Tagalog) or small chili peppers (siling labuyo in Tagalog), coconut milk/coconut cream (kakang gata in Tagalog), shrimp paste (bagoong alamang in Tagalog) or stockfish, onion, pork, ginger and garlic.</p>
        <p>The dish was termed by Laguna resident, Cely Kalaw, during a cooking competition in the 1970s in Malate, Manila.</p>  </p>
        <p>The name of the dish was inspired by the Bicol Express railway train (Philippine National Railways) that operated from Tutuban, Manila to Legazpi, Albay (regional center of the Bicol region).</p>
