      <h2>What is Pork Adobo</h2>
        <p>The cooking method for the Philippine adobo is indigenous to the Philippines. The various Pre-colonial peoples of the country often cooked or prepared their food with vinegar and salt to preserve them in the tropical climate. </p>
        <p>Vinegar, in particular, is one of the most important ingredients in Filipino cuisine, with the main traditional types being coconut vinegar, cane vinegar, nipa palm vinegar, and kaong palm vinegar. These are all of which are linked to traditional alcohol fermentation.</p>
